# A different kind of contribution this year

Thereâ€™s a new way to contribute this yearâ€”financially. Hacktoberfest is the perfect time to give back to open source maintainers. Maintainers are the backbones of the software we all use. We all know backbones get sore after a long day, so consider sending them some support (and a lumbar pillow). The Hacktoberfest donation page is integrated with both GitHub Sponsors and OpenCollective to make it easy to find projects youâ€™d like to thank. While youâ€™re there, consider what smaller projects you benefit from and could especially use relative to resources.


# New to contributing in open source?

Hacktoberfest can be an especially welcoming time to dip your toes into open source contributions for the first time. Thereâ€™s plenty of streams, posts, guides, and conversations around getting started. Youâ€™re joining many folks also starting their journey this month!
