# Hi! I am Jesus Nu√±ez :wave:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cro22/Cro22/master/banner-2.jpg" alt="banner that says Jesus Nu√±ez - Full Stack Web Dev, WordPress plugin Dev,  Unreal Games Dev">
I am a web developer with a career in systems engineering from UNEFA-Aragua, Venezuela, I am a fan of learning new things.

I have worked on this for more than 4 years. I have used Laravel, NodeJs, MySQL, MongoDB, Vue CLI, Angular CLI, Go and Wordpress in my previous experiences

I love using Wordpress because it is open source and its modular architecture implemented within a plugin manager and theme system makes web development faster.

However, I consider that each tool should be used intelligently, which is why I like to realize analysis of requirements, data and business models, to recommend the development environment that best suits the needs of each project.

I believe that to achieve each objective of a project there must be good communication between the entire development team (I really like work teams) and that there must be a playful and coordinated atmosphere, where everyone can give voice to their ideas without fear.

I love video games (Nier Series, Borderlans Series, Metro Exodus, BioShock Series, they are some of my favorites) and good movies (Comedies, horror and, of course, fantasy).
