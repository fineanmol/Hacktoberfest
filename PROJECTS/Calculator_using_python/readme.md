## Running the Calculator App

To use the Calculator app, follow these steps:

### For Windows Users (Double-click Option):

1. **Locate the `app.exe` File**: If you're using Windows, you can simply locate the `app.exe` file that you obtained after converting the Python code. This is typically in the same directory where you saved the Python script.

2. **Double-Click `app.exe`**: You can run the Calculator app by double-clicking the `app.exe` file. Double-clicking will execute the app, and the graphical user interface will appear on your screen, allowing you to perform arithmetic calculations.

### For Command Line Usage (All Platforms):

1. **Open your Command Prompt or Terminal**: For advanced users or those on non-Windows platforms, you can also run the Calculator app from the command line.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   - Use the `cd` (Change Directory) command to navigate to the directory where you have saved the Calculator app's Python script.
   - For example, if your script is in a directory named "CalculatorApp," you can navigate to it using the following command:
   
     ```shell
     cd path/to/CalculatorApp
     ```

   Replace `path/to/CalculatorApp` with the actual path to your script's directory.

3. **Run the App**:
   - To run the Calculator app, use the `python` command followed by the name of the Python script.
   - For example, if your Python script is named "calculator_app.py," run the following command:
   
     ```shell
     python app.py
     ```

This command will execute the Calculator app, and the graphical user interface will appear on your screen, allowing you to perform arithmetic calculations.

Please make sure that you have Python installed on your system before running the app, as it is a prerequisite for running Python scripts.

Happy calculating!
