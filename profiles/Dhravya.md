## About
I am a 17 year old full-stack developer with a passion for building things that people love.

I've built highly scalable web applications, a Twitter bot that serves more than 20 thousand people and a discord bot that served more than 100k people, along with a lot of other fun and interesting projects. I'm proficient in Python, Javascript and a little bit of Typescript. I also write code in Rust and Golang.

In my free time, I love to Cycle, listen to music, play the Guitar and Table tennis.
